# Studying Advices

## 1. Study in short sessions
Instead of one long session, study for 25–50 minutes, then take a 5–10 minute break. This method keeps your mind fresh.

## 2. Review regularly
Revisit material after 1 day, 3 days, and a week to move it into long-term memory.

## 3. Test yourself
Use flashcards or practice questions instead of only rereading your notes.

## 4. Avoid distractions
Turn off notifications and keep your study area clean and quiet.

## 5. Sleep well
A rested brain remembers more and learns faster.
