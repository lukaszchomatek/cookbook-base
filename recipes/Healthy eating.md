# Healthy Meal Recipes

**Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken with Quinoa & Veggies**
Ingredients:

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon paprika

Zest and juice of 1 lemon

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 cup quinoa

2 cups water or low-sodium chicken broth

1 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., zucchini, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes)

Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

> Instructions:

Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, combine olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, paprika, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Coat the chicken breasts in the marinade, then let them sit for at least 20 minutes (or up to 2 hours) in the fridge.

Cook quinoa: In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water (or broth) to a boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Fluff with a fork.

Grill the chicken: Preheat the grill or a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).

Cook veggies: In a skillet, sauté your mixed vegetables with a little olive oil over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, until tender.

Serve: Plate the quinoa, top with grilled chicken, and serve with the sautéed veggies. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.

**Salmon and Asparagus with Garlic Lemon Sauce**
Ingredients:

2 salmon fillets

1 bunch asparagus, trimmed

2 tablespoons olive oil

3 garlic cloves, minced

Zest and juice of 1 lemon

Salt and pepper, to taste

Fresh dill or parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)

Prepare the asparagus: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss the asparagus with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange on a baking sheet and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until tender.

Cook the salmon: While the asparagus is roasting, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place the fillets skin-side down in the skillet and cook for 4-5 minutes per side, until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.

Make the garlic lemon sauce: In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Pour the sauce over the cooked salmon fillets.

Serve: Plate the salmon with the roasted asparagus, drizzle with the garlic lemon sauce, and garnish with fresh dill or parsley if desired.
