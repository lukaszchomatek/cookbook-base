# The Feynman Technique: Learn Anything Faster

The Feynman Technique is a simple, powerful mental model for learning any complex topic. It was named after Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for his ability to explain difficult concepts in simple terms.

The process forces you to truly understand a subject by breaking it down and explaining it simply.

## The 4-Step Process

1.  **Choose Your Concept:**
    Select the topic you want to understand (e.g., "photosynthesis," "blockchain," or a coding concept). Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank piece of paper.

2.  **Explain It Like You're Teaching a Child (ELi5):**
    Write out an explanation of the concept using the simplest language possible. Avoid jargon. Use analogies. Pretend you are teaching it to someone with no prior knowledge (like a 10-year-old).

3.  **Identify Gaps and Simplify:**
    When you get stuck, or when you find yourself using complex terms, you've found a gap in your own understanding. Go back to your source material (books, notes, articles) to fill in these gaps. Keep refining your explanation until it's simple and clear.

4.  **Review and Refine:**
    Read your simplified explanation out loud. If it doesn't sound smooth or simple, refine it again. If you can explain the concept from start to finish in plain language, you have successfully learned it.
